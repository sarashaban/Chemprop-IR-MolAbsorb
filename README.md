# Chemprop-IR-MolAbsorb

### This repository contains the source code for Chemprop-IR, featuring the communicative message passing neural network (CMPNN) architecture, along with supplementary files for our paper titled 

### 'Prediction of the Infrared Absorbance Intensities and Frequencies of Hydrocarbons: A Message Passing Neural Network Approach'. 



The code was built based on [Chemprop-IR](https://github.com/gfm-collab/chemprop-IR) and [CMPNN](https://github.com/SY575/CMPNN) algorithm. Thanks a lot for their code sharing!
