# Chemprop-IR-MolAbsorb

This repository contains the source code and supplementary materials developed for our paper:

**"Prediction of the Infrared Absorbance Intensities and Frequencies of Hydrocarbons: A Message Passing Neural Network Approach"**


This codebase was developed by extending [Chemprop-IR](https://github.com/gfm-collab/chemprop-IR) and incorporating the [CMPNN](https://github.com/SY575/CMPNN) algorithm. We gratefully acknowledge their open-source contributions.
